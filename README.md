# Car Brand Classification using CNN with VGG16

## Project Overview
This project focuses on car brand classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with the VGG16 architecture as the backbone. The model was developed to accurately classify images into various car brand categories.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust model capable of identifying and classifying car brands based on image data. This is useful for applications in automotive identification, marketing analysis, and enhanced user experiences in car-related applications.

## Model Architecture
The project utilizes the VGG16 architecture, which is known for its deep layers and strong performance in image classification tasks. VGG16, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, was fine-tuned on a custom dataset of car brand images to improve classification accuracy for specific brands.

### Why VGG16?
- **Deep Architecture**: VGG16 has 16 layers, providing a rich feature representation.
- **Proven Performance**: It has been successful in multiple large-scale image recognition tasks.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset allow for efficient fine-tuning, improving model performance and reducing training time.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises thousands of labeled images, each representing a specific car brand. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to increase model robustness and handle class imbalance.
